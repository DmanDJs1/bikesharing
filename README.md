## For this challenge we were asked to put together a presentation for a business proposal to attain investment for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines Iowa. We utilized data from NYC to find trends that would help convince our investors that a bike-sharing business could also be a viable and sound business in Des Moines. To solidify and win the proposal, one of the key stakeholders requested to see a bike trip analysis that would show trends based on:
1)	How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. 
2)	How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders. 
3)	A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results:

1) The following shows the times that most bikes are being rented.

2) Here we see who is renting the bikes. The gender breakdown shows that the majority of people using bikes are males.

3) The following graph shows the length of time that the bikes were checked out by all riders. checked out for all riders.

4) This graph show the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.

5) This graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. The darker the color shows the higher concentration of bike rentals. 

6) This graphs shows graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. Again we see the dominance male riders have over rentals. 

7) The following shows graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap.



## Summary:
Based on the data most of the individuals doing the renting of the bike are males. The times they are doing the renting show a clear indication that they are using them for commuting to and from work. We would also like to see more rider subsciption and an increase in female ridership. 
Running an aggressive marketing campaign directed at females would be beneficial to increasing ridership.

Additional visualizations could be where we can leverage promoting the bike sharing to more women.  
Also, where can we find different age groups to market to. Finding this information would increase our overall business reach and ridership among other groups for purpose of renting for leisure.
